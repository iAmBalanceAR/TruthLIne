            <div class="content">Let's modify the code to show predictions and increase line widths. We'll add a prediction line after the 3rd segment (when we have enough data to make meaningful predictions):

[Code]

This will:
- Make both the actual path and prediction lines thicker
- Show the prediction in a distinct green color
- Keep the prediction visible after segment 3
- Display the confidence level in the caption

The prediction line will appear after the 3rd segment (about 15% into the path), which is where we typically have enough data to make a meaningful prediction. You'll be able to see how closely the prediction matches the final path as it continues to form.

Would you like me to add:
- Multiple prediction lines with different confidence levels?
- Color coding based on prediction accuracy?
- A visual marker at the prediction point?
- Statistics comparing predicted vs actual path?</div>

            <div class="content">we'll need to increase resolution if we add too much more in the way of lines. It'll be hard to follow. Can we also maybe make the motion of the lines fluid and slow them down by maybe 30%? Where they draw through the cloud at a pleasing rate</div>
