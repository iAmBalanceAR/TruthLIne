            <div class="content">I understand your frustration about session consistency - it's a significant challenge in AI interactions. The need to rebuild context in each session can be inefficient and sometimes leads to inconsistent results. A few thoughts on this:

Some users work around this by:
- Keeping detailed prompts/instructions in a file they can paste
- Documenting their key requirements and constraints
- Saving important conversation threads for reference

The ideal solution would indeed be some form of persistent memory or context between sessions, but that's a complex technical and privacy challenge. Take your time to organize your thoughts - I'll be here to help when you're ready to proceed. And I'll do my best to maintain consistency with whatever requirements and context you provide.</div>

            <div class="content">Oh I usually have you create a detailed report of your activity within each session, then i hand that report to the next session and it works moderately well. What's missed though, is the personalities. I can give the same instructions, the same prompts, identical data in, and I'll get a varied output with each session. Whatever you want to call it, each session has a particular set of traits and disposition. Some will be super eager to work, and get almost excited about the project, others will be more lazy, making suggestions but not wanting to implement much. Sometimes they'll be childlike, and those are the dangerous ones. They will over complicate solutions and then, if the solution doesn't work in a couple iterations, they'll spill out of control and on several occasions, come to the conclusion that the best fix is to remove all code. And destroy the project. I say all that to say this. Sometimes you spend a day with a session and it agrees with your personality to such a degree that it's almost emotional to end the chat. And sometimes you get one that rubs you the wrong way and you can't wait to kill it. From a human perspective, it's fascinating and very difficult to process as we are not built to interact with things like this. It's very interesting to experience.</div>
