            <div class="content">Awesome! The visualization is working! I can see the cloud of points with the axis helpers. The colors are coming through nicely with those yellow-green hues against the dark blue background. Now that we have the basic visualization working, we can start implementing the "truth line" concept. Would you like to:

- Add a line that represents the optimal path through the token cloud
- Add controls to manipulate the visualization (like weight thresholds)
- Color the points based on their "weight" or influence
- Add animation to show the path finding process

The current visualization gives us a good foundation to start exploring how to represent token weights and their relationships visually. What aspect would you like to focus on first? Also, I notice the axis helpers (the red, green, and blue lines) are visible - these can help us understand the orientation and scale of our space. Would you like to keep those or should we remove them as we move forward with the visualization?</div>
