            <div class="content">Perfect! Let's break this down into steps:

First, let's update the HTML to add a legend and caption area... Let's update the visualization code:

[Code]

Would you like me to continue with the path animation code? The changes so far:
- Black background
- Circular points instead of squares
- Enhanced colors for better visibility
- Added legend
- Added caption area
- Spherical distribution of points

Let me know if you want to adjust any of these before we add the animated path!

Error creating visualization: animate Path is not defined

Ah yes, let's add the path animation code! Here's the complete animation system:

This animation system will:
- Start from a point in the cloud
- Find the next highest weight point within a certain radius
- Draw a glowing white line between points
- Continue until it has created a path of 20 segments
- Update the caption to show progress

The path finding uses a simple "greedy" algorithm that:
- Looks for points within a search radius
- Picks the point with the highest weight
- Avoids revisiting points
- Creates a smooth path through the token cloud

Would you like me to adjust any aspects of the animation, like:
- Speed of the animation
- Length of the path
- Color or thickness of the line
- Search radius for finding next points</div>
