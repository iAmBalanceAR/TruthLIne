            <div class="content">Let's create a simple proof-of-concept visualization. We'll start by creating a dataset of token weights and try to plot an optimal path through them.

*// First, let's create a basic 3D space with token weights*

This is just a starting point. To really visualize this, we'd need to:
- Add a proper 3D visualization library
- Implement color mapping for weights
- Add proper vector calculations
- Implement better path-finding algorithms

Want to focus on any particular aspect to develop further? We could:
- Improve the path-finding algorithm
- Add better visualization
- Implement proper vector mathematics
- Add real token data instead of random values</div>
