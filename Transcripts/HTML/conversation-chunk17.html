            <div class="content">Given our earlier discussion about finding the optimal path through token weights, I think we should:

First, let's modify the token cloud to represent actual token weights:

This approach would:
- Create a more meaningful distribution of points
- Assign weights to each point
- Color points based on their weights
- Draw a line through the highest-weight path

Would you like me to continue with the implementation of the path-finding logic? We could also add controls to:
- Adjust the weight threshold
- Show/hide the axis helpers
- Animate the path finding process

What aspects would you like to focus on first?</div>
