            <div class="content">Actually, in the previous version when we were using (Math.Random() - 0.5) * 8 for all three coordinates, we were essentially creating points within a cube because each coordinate (x, y, z) was being randomly distributed within the same range [-4, 4].

With our new code, we're using cylindrical coordinates:

[Code]

This should create more of a cylindrical distribution because:
- Points are distributed radially around the y-axis using sine and cosine
- The height varies linearly along the y-axis
- The radius determines how far from the center axis the point is

Would you like to try different distributions? We could:
- Create a spherical distribution
- Create a Gaussian (normal) distribution
- Create a more focused cone shape
- Create multiple clusters

For example, for a spherical distribution we could use:
[Code]

Which distribution would be most useful for visualizing the token weight space?</div>

            <div class="content">I'll be honest.. I'm in over my head now. I think we need a legend that denotes what each color represents. If the points could be more like dots than squares... And if we could float this on a black bg and adjust the colors to look good on that.. and for the truth line, can we animate that as it passes through the cloud? What about making it a loop, with captions below the cloud Sudo narrating what's going on.</div>
