            <div class="content">Let's debug the prediction visualization. The issue might be that we're not properly handling the prediction display. Let's modify the prediction-related code:

[Code]

The changes:
- Added debug logging
- Fixed how we pass the predicted path to showPrediction
- Added checks for valid prediction data
- Increased prediction line opacity
- Made sure we're properly handling the prediction line in the scene

This should help us see where the prediction visualization might be failing. Let me know if you see the debug messages in the console and if the prediction line appears now.</div>
